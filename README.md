## 📋 Update Log

### V3.15
- Fixes:
  1. Fixed: DSS/ASS will not move
  2. Optimized text in some pop-up dialogs
- Known issue: Democratic Dark Mode does not apply random intensity bonuses

### V3.14
- **Fixed**: Reworked batch attack logic; added supply line connectivity validation to determine whether a target planet can be reached.

### V3.13 (BUG version)
- **Fixed**: Bug fix attempts failed; this is not an official stable version.

### V3.12
- **Fixed**: Optimized attack logic, using unified total troop calculation instead of previous sequential troop simulation.
- **Known issues**: Cannot attack if adjacent friendly planet has zero points; troop calculation errors exist.

### V3.11
- **New feature**: Supports direct box selection.
- **Known issues**: Cannot attack if adjacent friendly planet has zero points; attack calculation errors occur when points are insufficient.

### V3.1
- **New feature**: Shift box selection; removed old Shift multi‑select mode.
- **Known issues**: Troop calculation errors exist.

### V3.0
- **Fixed**: Fixed unlimited stacking issue for Haze and Silent Domain.
- **Balance**: Removed dissipation mechanic; retained 5‑point continuous troop attrition effect.
- **Known issues**: Mini‑map has isolated region rendering/logic issues.

### V2.9 / V2.91 (test BUG versions)
- **New feature**: Attempted to develop Shift box selection; later abandoned.

### V2.8
- **New feature**: Galaxy map supports zoom.

### V2.7
- **Balance**: Maximum 4 Haze/Silent Domain per planet; after a planet is captured, Haze and Silent Domain will cause troop attrition for 2 rounds, then dissipate.

### V2.6 – Super Aggressive Version (scrapped)
> Plan abandoned; not officially released.
- **Balance**: Use BFS traversal to compute the shortest jumps from each planet to the front line; rear troops can only be transferred to adjacent friendly planets that are closer to the front line, achieving gradual troop concentration toward the front.

### V2.5 / V2.4
- **Fixed**:
  1. After capturing an enemy homeworld, its subsequent capture no longer triggers the "our homeworld has fallen" pop‑up.
  2. Increased brightness of lane display.
  3. After selecting an enemy/neutral planet, a prompt appears and selection is automatically canceled.
- **Balance**:
  - DSS and ASS units cannot be eliminated.
  - Defense +20, Weaken –30.
  - They can move to enemy planets; upon arrival, 20 points are deducted.
  - Can only move once per turn.

### V2.34
- **Fixed**: Silent Domain and Haze were incorrectly deployed on enemy planets.

### V2.33
- **Fixed**: AI would not actively deploy or use Silent Domain and Haze.

### V2.32
- **Fixed**: Mairafenmeng River spawned outside the galactic map boundary.

### V2.31
- **New feature**: Added starting random events (test version, balance continuously adjusted).
- **Fixed**: After assembling troops, you can directly launch an attack.
- **Balance**: Mairafenmeng River troop count adjusted to 10.

### V2.22
- **New feature**: Shift to assemble troops (assembly only, cannot directly launch attack).
- **Fixed**: Optimized homeworld fall pop‑up logic:
  - Pop‑up only triggers on first fall.
  - No repeated pop‑ups during back‑and‑forth faction struggles.
  - Own homeworld will not incorrectly trigger the pop‑up.
